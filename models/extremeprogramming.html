            <td>Extreme Programming is code centric and trims some activities to reduce costs and developers focus on coding instead of needless paperwork and meetings.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>XP is reduces the risks related to programming. Normally programming depends a lot on individuals key team members. In XP, Using module structure, and pair programing XP spreads the risk and mitigate the dependence on individuals</td>
